# PackNet-SFM PyTorch version
This codebase almost implements(unofficial) the system described in the paper:

> **PackNet-SfM: 3D Packing for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation**
>
> V. Guizilini, R. Ambrus, S. Pillai, and A. Gaidon

> \[ [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02693), [video](https://youtu.be/-N8QFtL3ees), [ICML'19 SSL wkshp](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4M2lUVyJzS4RmpJWTVRTHMtWHZPQ3V5VG85VDA0bENfSUJJ) \]

## Code Removed!

<b> As there are many differences compared to original paper and  the author released their training and testing code, I deleted code at master branch but keep going at dev branch, you can go to [packnet-sfm(code published)](https://github.com/TRI-ML/packnet-sfm) for all detail. </b>
